==============

Here's some mixins that I created or integrate from other people. It's very useful!
Obviously, you can add or modified those mixins for your own code.

Enjoy!

===========================

Exemple of the syntax I use:

@import "_debug-elements";


/*****************/

/**
* @tags:  project colors variables
*/

@import "_colors";

/*****************/

/**
* @tags:  base styles
* @usage: Declaration of every common mixins / placeholder || _core.function.scss is imported into this file
*/

@import "_projectname-var";

/*****************/

/**
* @tags:  project styles
* @usage: Main styles of the website
*/

@import "_projectname-sceen";
