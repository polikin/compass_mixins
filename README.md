compass_mixins
==============

Here's some mixins that I created or integrate from other people. It's very useful!
Obviously, you can add or modified those mixins for your own code.    

Now with:    
- Susy Responsive Grid (http://susy.oddbird.net/)    
- Ceaser CSS3 Animations (https://github.com/jhardy/compass-ceaser-easing)    
- GetSkeleton Grid (https://github.com/theresponsiveness/GetSkeleton1200-or-960 & http://getskeleton.com/)    

No need to install any gems.

#####Usage (Compass is needed)

`@import "_charcoal-core"` - everything (GetSkeleton Grid, Susy Grid, Ceaser, Custom mixins)
